									Bulbasaur '01
								</header>
								<div class="blurb">
									 <p>Bulbasaur is a quadruped, reptilian creature that somewhat resembles a toad or a young dinosaur with a spotted blue-green hide. It has three white toes or claws growing out of its four legs, and its eyes are a bright red. The most notable feature of this Pokémon is the onion-like bulb on its back, which grows from a seed planted on its back by its mother at birth.</p>

									 <p>Ivysaur, like its pre-evolved form, Bulbasaur, resembles a toad or a quadruped dinosaur, though the patches in its skin cause it to resemble a dinosaur more closely. After evolving from Bulbasaur, Ivysaur grows small fangs and has visible ear insides and pupils. Ivysaur's skin is also a little bit bluer than Bulbasaur's.</p>

									 <p>Venusaur is considerably larger and heavier than both of its pre-evolutions are, and as such, it moves slower than the two when it is not in battle, though it retains its quadruped form. The bud on its back has since bloomed into a large red flower with six expansive, white-spotted petals, supported on a brown trunk somewhat like that of a palm tree.</p>

They resemble a light blue turtle with their most notable feature being the hard shell on their back. This shell forms and hardens on its back after birth. They could perhaps be distantly related to some other turtle-like Pokémon, such as Torkoal and Turtwig, but Squirtle seems to only be closely related to their evolutions.</p>

							<p>Paris–Brussels was first run on 12 August 1893 as an amateur event over a distance of 397 km, Belgian Andre Henry took the inaugural victory from compatriot Charles Delbecque with France's Fernand Augenault coming in third. The race did not return to the racing calendar until 1906 when it was run as a two day event on the 3rd and 4 June. The first stage of this 1906 event was run from the Paris suburb of Villiers-sur-Marne to Reims over 152 km and was won by France's Maurice Bardonneau. Albert Dupont took the more challenging second stage on the following day from Reims to Brussels over 239 km to take the overall race victory from compatriots Jules Patou and Guillaume Coeckelberg. The following year the race reverted to being a one day race and quickly established itself as one of the Spring Classics with a date towards the end of April, between Paris–Roubaix and Gent–Wevelgem. The event lost its prestige during the 1960s when the race was beset by traffic problems between the two capitals and the Dutch promoted Amstel Gold Race took its place on the classics calendar. The race was not run between 1967 and 1972.</p>

							<p>The film begins with two high school sweethearts, Lawrence (played by Luke Roberston) and Caroline (played by Laura Breckenridge). They are about to go off to college, but claim they will stay together nonetheless. The film then jumps forward 25 years, and Lawrence (played by Frank Wood) is living back in his hometown, Bayonne, New Jersey, and is a photographer who photographs pets, as well as criminals at the local police station. He receives a surprise phone call from Caroline (played by Paige Turco), who has recently come back home in order to care for her sick father and who is divorced and has a troubled teenage son Johnny (played by Ryan Donowho). Caroline and Lawrence go on a date and rekindle their relationship, but shortly afterwards she dies in a freak accident. Johnny's father Harris (played by Aldo Perez) does not want to take care of him, and he will be going into foster care. When Johnny has a seizure at his mother's funeral, Lawrence decides to adopt him. The bulk of the film is about Lawrence and Johnny, and how Lawrence tries to be a father to Johnny while Johnny rejects him. Johnny also has a relationship with a neighborhood girl, Mariana (played by Isidra Vega), and problems with the local drug dealer Carter (played by Jesse Kelly).</p>
