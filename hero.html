								Now this is a story all about how my life got twisted upside down and I'd like to take a minute just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air</p>

								<p>In west Philadelphia born and raised on the playground my momma said most of my days chilling out, maxing and relaxing all cool and all shooting some b-ball outside of school when a couple of guys they were up to no good started making trouble in our neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared she said your moving in with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air</p>

								<p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said "fresh" and had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare but I thought nah, forget it yo home to Bel-Air!</p>

								<p>I pulled up to a house about seven or eight; I yelled to the cabbie, "yo home, smell you later!" Looked at my kingdom I was finally there to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.</p>
